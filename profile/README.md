# alpaDrive
A passion project by a couple of auto enthusiasts to bring the latest tech features to those old gas guzzling revving set of wheels laying around in your garage.

In the initial version, we are planning to start by enabling cloud connectivity in legacy vehicles. This would consist of a small device that can be connected to your vehicle's OBD port and be powered via USB, a mobile app and a server.

In an ideal scenario, the device would connect to your existing car and should be able to be paired with your alpaDrive user account via the app. You would then be able to use the app to track your car in real-time.
